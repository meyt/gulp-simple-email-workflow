# Simple gulp emails workflow

a simple gulp workflow for building email templates.

## What's inside?
- CSS Preprocessor (sass)
- Advanced template engine (nunjucks)
- Default style and template for quick-start
- Task runner (gulp)
- And some tools for optimizing output

## What's doing?
- Compile SASS to CSS
- Compile Templates to HTML
- Re-build HTML with some optimization
And finally it's watch for your changes (in `images`, `scss` and `templates` directory)
to re-build output automatically.

## How to use?
Follow the routine (`git clone`, `cd`, `npm install`, `gulp`) and watch ðŸ‘€ the `output` directory.
